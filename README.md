# PoShDNSHealthReport
This script runs DCDiag and variables to generate an HTML report on the health of DNS. The data table will be displayed with the health of your DNS servers.

Must be an Administrator to run this.

I am not the original creator of this PS script I modified it to help generate daily reports

I usually put this in a scheduled task for a weekly report.
